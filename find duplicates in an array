Given an array a of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1]. 

Note: The extra space is only for the array to be returned. Try and perform all operations within the provided array. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
a[] = {0,3,1,2}
Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
There is no repeating element in the array. Therefore output is -1.

CODE EXPLNATION

from collections import Counter
def duplicates(self, arr, n): 
  l1=[]
  l2=[-1]
  x=Counter(arr)
  for i in x.keys():
       if x[i]>1:
            l1.append(i)
  l1.sort()
  return l1 if len(l1)>0 else l2
